Multi Layer Perceptron model trained to predict the type of a review (positive or negative) along with its score, using a dataset containing past reviews.

## Further refinements:
The performance of the model could increase significantly by using a recurrent neural network on the text of the reviews before feeding them to the MLP (to be done)
